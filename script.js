    ⚖️ Judge Final Exam Case 1: The Rooftop Silence
Characters: Riez, Cheska, Jhaylord, Stephanie, Yhanna, Elton
Summary:
On a rainy Thursday night, Riez is found dead, having fallen from the rooftop of the university’s abandoned science building. No signs of forced entry, no CCTV coverage — just his lifeless body, a cracked phone nearby, and a shattered umbrella. The only people confirmed to be at the university after 7 PM were Cheska, Jhaylord, Stephanie, Yhanna, and Elton, all claiming different reasons for staying late. But one thing ties them all together: every single one of them had a conflict with Riez that week.

🕵️ Evidence Report:
Time of Death: Estimated between 7:25 PM and 8:00 PM.

Riez’s phone had a voice recording titled “Just in case” — the file is corrupted.

The rooftop door was unlocked, though it’s normally kept locked after 6 PM.

An open umbrella was found on the rooftop — unbroken. Another umbrella, shattered, was found next to the body.

No fingerprints on the rooftop railing, but muddy footprints lead toward the edge.

Cheska’s fingerprints were found on the rooftop door.

Yhanna's locker had Riez’s missing watch inside, but she says she “found it near the staircase.”

Jhaylord’s alibi was being in the computer lab. No witnesses confirm that.

🔍 Character Statements:
Cheska:
“I was in the journalism room finishing layout. I left around 8. I did pass the rooftop stairs, but I didn’t go up! I just tried the door out of curiosity. It wasn’t locked, that’s all. I didn’t even see Riez that day.”

Jhaylord:
“He accused me of cheating in the elections. I didn’t care. I was fixing my thesis in the computer lab. Alone. Yes, we fought, but I wouldn’t kill over a dumb student council seat.”

Stephanie:
“He sent screenshots of my personal texts to our professor. I was humiliated. But I wouldn’t kill him! I was at the library… Yhanna saw me there, right?”

Yhanna:
“I don’t want to be involved. I saw Stephanie at the library but I don’t know the time. I went up to the rooftop before 7 PM because it’s quiet there, but I left before the rain started.”

Elton:
“Riez made fun of my speech in front of everyone. Sure, I was mad. But I stayed in the music room after practice. Alone. Didn’t see anyone until I went home.”

⚖️ The Dilemma:
Cheska touched the rooftop door, but claims she didn’t go up.

Yhanna was last seen near the rooftop before the rain.

Riez was pushed (there are marks on the railing), but there’s no DNA, just muddy footprints.

The shattered umbrella matches Cheska’s bag (she claims it was stolen last week).

Stephanie has motive, but no direct link to the rooftop.

The corrupted voice recording cannot be recovered.

    ⚖️ Judge Final Exam – Case 2: The Bitter Harvest
Overview:
In the quiet farming town of San Rael, a body is discovered buried beneath a cornfield. A family torn apart by inheritance, buried secrets, and unspoken rivalries becomes the center of a murder investigation.

🕵️‍♀️ Victim:
Cheska Alcantara, age 32 — eldest daughter of a wealthy landowner. Recently returned from the city after years of no contact with her family.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Key People Involved:
Riez Alcantara – youngest sibling, 22, student, stayed on the farm

Jhaylord Alcantara – middle sibling, 28, ran the farm after the father died

Stephanie Ramos – family friend and caretaker of their late father

Yhanna Villanueva – Cheska’s former best friend, now estranged

Elton Ruiz – neighbor, recently fired from working on the farm

🧩 The Situation:
Cheska returned to San Rael after 10 years to claim her “share” of the farm estate left by their late father, who died 6 months earlier.

The will, however, only mentioned Jhaylord as inheritor of the land.

A week after a heated family dinner, Cheska vanished.

Two weeks later, her body was found beneath a cornfield, wrapped in tarp and plastic, with head trauma and signs of post-mortem burial.

🧪 Forensic Report:
Cause of death: Single blunt force trauma to the head

Time of death: Between 10 PM and 12 AM on the night of her disappearance

Signs of struggle on her right arm, and torn fingernails

Soil and plastic matching farm equipment found on her clothes

🔍 Witness Statements:
🧑‍🌾 Jhaylord Alcantara:
"She came back thinking she could just take over everything. My dad trusted me to keep the farm alive. We argued, yes, but I didn’t kill her. She left the house that night angry, and that was the last I saw her."

🎓 Riez Alcantara:
"I wasn’t even at the house. I was sleeping at my girlfriend’s place in town. Cheska wanted to sell the land. We fought too — she said we were all leeches. But kill her? I couldn’t do that."

🧕 Stephanie Ramos:
"Cheska said something that night… that she found an older copy of the will in the shed. She seemed shaken. I don’t know if she really did. I think she suspected Jhaylord had changed something."

💼 Yhanna Villanueva:
"Cheska ruined lives before she even left town. She blackmailed people. She knew how to twist things. When I heard she was missing, I thought maybe she just ran off again. Guess not."

🧑‍🔧 Elton Ruiz:
"Jhaylord fired me a month ago — said I stole tools. I didn’t. Maybe Cheska found out something. I dunno. But you should ask who knew about the shed. Not many people even go near it."

🧾 Additional Evidence:
An unburned corner of a will was found in the firepit behind the farmhouse.

Jhaylord’s boots had soil traces matching the grave site.

Security footage from a nearby store caught Stephanie buying a tarp and gloves one day before Cheska’s death.

Riez’s alibi was confirmed — he appeared on CCTV entering his girlfriend’s condo at 9:52 PM.

The shed contained a burnt pile of papers, ashes matching document ink.

⚖️ The Accusation:
Jhaylord is charged with the murder of Cheska, on suspicion of killing her to protect his inheritance and disposing of the body on the farm.

    ⚖️ Judge Final Exam – Case 3: The Riverbed Pact
Overview:
A camping trip gone wrong leaves one friend dead, and the others tangled in conflicting stories. When the body washes up days later, the question remains — was it an accident, or premeditated murder?

🧍‍♀️ Victim:
Yhanna Cruz, age 19 — student, known to be quiet, deeply emotional, and reclusive. Joined her five friends on a spontaneous riverside camping trip.

🧍 People on the Trip:
Riez Mateo – 19, Yhanna's childhood friend, seen as the group’s "leader"

Jhaylord Mendez – 20, jokester of the group, easily angered

Stephanie Del Rosario – 19, Yhanna’s roommate and only real confidant

Elton Pineda – 21, Yhanna's ex-boyfriend, invited by Stephanie

Cheska Lim – 18, social media influencer, barely knew Yhanna

📅 Timeline of Events:
The group hiked to River Montalban, 2 hours outside the city.

The trip was unplanned. They brought alcohol, no tents, and intended to just “chill overnight.”

Sometime between 2 AM and 4 AM, Yhanna disappeared.

Her body was found four days later, half-submerged in a shallow bend of the river, 500 meters downstream.

🧪 Forensic Report:
Cause of death: Asphyxiation from drowning

Head trauma consistent with falling or being pushed against a rock

No alcohol in her blood, though several in the group were intoxicated

Bruising around her wrists and upper arm — possibly restrained

🔍 Key Testimonies:
🧑‍🎓 Riez:
“We were just vibing. She wandered off — we thought she went to the bathroom or something. Next thing we know, she’s gone. It was dark, we had one flashlight.”

🤡 Jhaylord:
“She was sitting at the river’s edge, talking to Elton. I told her she was acting weird. I didn’t hurt her. But people don’t just fall into rivers and drown.”

🧕 Stephanie:
“Yhanna told me she didn’t even want to come. But Elton begged me to bring her, he said they needed to talk. She said she had a bad feeling about it.”

💔 Elton:
“I wanted closure. We didn’t end well, okay? We were arguing at the water, but I didn’t touch her. I walked away. I swear I walked away.”

📸 Cheska:
“She didn’t like me. I think she thought I was fake. But why would I kill someone I barely knew? Everyone was fighting. The vibe was just bad.”

🧾 Additional Evidence:
Stephanie’s bag contained Yhanna’s journal, where the last entry read:

“If anything happens to me, ask why Elton wanted me here.”

A photo on Cheska’s phone, timestamped 3:12 AM, shows Yhanna lying on the rocks, wet and dazed, while Jhaylord and Elton are arguing in the background.

Riez’s shirt was found washed and drying inside a tree hollow — river mud and blood detected.

A bruise on Yhanna’s wrist matches the grip pattern of Elton’s dominant hand.

The flashlight was recovered, batteries removed and tossed 50m away in the bushes.

⚖️ The Accusation:
Elton Pineda is charged with 3rd degree murder, suspected of pushing Yhanna during a heated argument, leading to her death by drowning.
There are also questions about Jhaylord and Riez's involvement in covering it up.

   ⚖️ Judge Final Exam – Case 4: Stephanie’s Silence
Overview:
A quiet, well-respected girl is accused of killing her father — a powerful judge. But her refusal to speak during the trial makes the truth even harder to uncover. What really happened that night?

🧍‍♀️ Victim:
Hon. Ernesto Del Rosario, 51 – A respected judge known for being strict, both in court and at home.
He was found stabbed 13 times in his study, inside their locked home.

🧍 Primary Suspect:
Stephanie Del Rosario, 19 – his daughter, honors student, university debater, recently withdrawn from public life.

📍 Crime Scene:
The Del Rosario family home in a gated subdivision.

Only 3 people in the house that night: Stephanie, her father Ernesto, and housemaid Amelia.

The maid was sleeping in the servant’s quarters.

No signs of forced entry.

Blood was found on Stephanie’s sleeves.

🔍 Timeline:
8:00 PM – Ernesto arrives home. Maid hears him yelling at Stephanie from upstairs.

9:30 PM – Maid hears a thud, followed by silence.

10:00 PM – Maid finds Ernesto’s body on the floor of his study, door open. Stephanie was sitting across the room, staring blankly.

10:15 PM – Police arrive. Stephanie does not resist arrest, but says nothing.

🧪 Forensic Evidence:
Victim died from multiple stab wounds to the chest and neck.

No defensive wounds – suggests surprise attack or immobilization.

Kitchen knife used; fingerprints wiped off.

Stephanie’s school sweater had blood spatter matching the victim.

Security logs confirm no one entered or exited the house between 8 PM and 10 PM.

📔 Additional Findings:
Stephanie’s journal, entry from 2 weeks before:

“I hate him. I hate what he did to mom. I can’t sleep anymore.”

Mother’s death occurred 3 months prior — ruled suicide, though rumors suggest abuse.

Stephanie’s friend (Yhanna) testified that Stephanie once whispered:

“If I ever disappear, just remember, he was never a father. Just a monster with power.”

Counselor report reveals Stephanie was treated for PTSD symptoms and showed signs of prolonged emotional trauma.

🧾 Witness Statements:
🧑‍🍳 Amelia (Maid):
“They argued a lot. Sir was very angry lately, especially after Ma’am died. I thought he would hit her that night. But I didn’t think she’d… I didn’t think she could do something like this.”

🧑‍🦱 Riez:
“Steph was never violent. But she was scared of her dad. That’s all she ever really said.”

🧔 Elton:
“If you ask me, she didn’t kill him in rage. If she did, he deserved it.”

🔇 Stephanie:
Has refused to speak during police questioning and trial, despite multiple pleas. She stares at the floor, lips sealed.

⚖️ The Accusation:
Stephanie is charged with 2nd Degree Murder — intent to kill in the heat of passion, without premeditation.

⚠️ Complications:
Her silence makes it impossible to confirm self-defense, mental illness, or confession.

Circumstantial evidence suggests motive and opportunity, but no direct confession or witness.

   ⚖️ Judge Final Exam – Case 5: The Alley Pact
Overview:
Three best friends. One bloody night. A “pact” to protect each other — but someone didn’t keep their word. Now, one is dead, and two are on trial. What really happened behind the nightclub?

🧍‍♀️ Victim:
Cheska Alvarez, 18 — kind-hearted, funny, and deeply loyal. Died from blunt force trauma to the back of the head.

🧍 Primary Suspects:
Elton Pascual, 18 — outgoing, known for drinking and fights.

Jhaylord Ramos, 17 — quiet, protective, Cheska’s childhood best friend.

Riez, 18 — all-around good kid, Cheska’s crush according to messages.

📍 Crime Scene:
The alley behind Nebula, an 18+ nightclub.

Body discovered at 3:12 AM, face down, behind a dumpster.

Blood trail suggests she was dragged.

Head trauma consistent with a metal pipe found nearby.

🔍 Timeline:
9:00 PM – Group enters Nebula using fake IDs.

12:30 AM – Eyewitness sees Cheska yelling at Elton outside.

1:00 AM – All three seen heading into alley.

1:35 AM – Elton seen leaving the alley alone, distressed.

3:12 AM – Body found by cleaning crew.

🧪 Forensics:
Metal pipe has Elton’s fingerprints.

Blunt force trauma to the back of the head — single, strong strike.

Small bruises on Cheska’s wrists — signs of struggle.

No drugs or alcohol found in Cheska’s system.

A message in her Notes app, unsent:

“He keeps saying he loves me but I just… I’m scared. I feel like he’s watching me. If anything happens, remember this.”

📔 Interviews:
🧑‍🦱 Riez:
“We were just out having fun. She went outside, said she needed air. Elton followed her. I didn’t see her again. I didn’t do anything!”

🧑 Elton:
“She and I argued, yes. I was drunk. But I didn’t kill her! I left her there, I swear. She was alive when I walked away!”

🧑‍🎓 Jhaylord:
“Elton was obsessed. He wouldn’t leave her alone. She wanted out. He thought he owned her.”

📲 Digital Evidence:
Messages between Cheska and Yhanna show she felt unsafe around Elton:

“He showed up outside my house again. I didn’t even tell him I was home.”

Cheska’s voice memo, recorded at 12:50 AM (30 minutes before death):

“He’s drunk. He keeps saying if he can’t have me, no one can. I should go.”

🧾 Final Twist:
Surveillance cam shows Riez re-entering the alley at 2:45 AM, nearly an hour after Elton left.

He stays for 3 minutes.

When asked, Riez said:

“I just… wanted to see. I didn’t touch anything. I swear. I didn’t kill her.”

⚖️ The Accusation:
Elton is charged with 2nd Degree Murder – heated act of violence.

Riez is charged with Obstruction of Justice – for revisiting and possibly disturbing the crime scene.

🔎 Theory:
Elton kills Cheska in an outburst of jealousy.

Riez, upon realizing she's dead, panics and goes back out of guilt — possibly to see her one last time.

Jhaylord had no direct involvement, but testified harshly.
