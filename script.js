Stephanie, Riez, and Elton were close friends in university. Stephanie had secretly been in a relationship with Riez for over a year, while Elton had feelings for her but never confessed. One evening, the group was drinking at Elton's condo when a heated argument erupted between Riez and Elton after Riez accidentally revealed the relationship. Elton stormed into the kitchen, slammed drawers, and came back with a knife.

Security camera footage shows Elton stabbing Riez five times. Stephanie, in shock, called the police. Elton didn‚Äôt flee and claimed it was "a moment of madness" driven by heartbreak.

Yhanna was a popular true crime podcaster. One day, she announced she'd be covering a case ‚Äúvery close to home.‚Äù That week, her neighbor Jhaylord was found dead, poisoned by cyanide-laced coffee. Investigators found traces of cyanide in Yhanna‚Äôs kitchen. Text messages revealed she had frequent arguments with Jhaylord over noise complaints.

In her podcast draft, investigators found a script labeled ‚ÄúEpisode 100: The Neighbor from Hell‚Äù describing details only the killer could know ‚Äî including time of death and method. Yhanna claims it was fictional and for dramatic purposes.

        sentenceOptions: true,
        correctSentence: "Heavy sentence",

        text: `Case 3:
Riez and Stephanie were classmates in a criminal law course. One day, their professor was found dead in the lecture hall. The weapon: a heavy textbook. No security cameras worked that day. Riez claimed they found the professor collapsed and tried to help. Stephanie said she saw Riez standing over the body, panicking and muttering "I didn‚Äôt mean to."

There were no signs of struggle. An autopsy revealed the professor had a heart condition worsened by blunt trauma. No fingerprints were on the book. The case hinges on Stephanie‚Äôs testimony alone.

        verdicts: ["Guilty", "Not Guilty", "Mistrial"],
        correctVerdict: "Mistrial",

Jhaylord, a known hacker, discovered that Cheska was embezzling funds from the student council. He confronted her late at night at school. The next morning, Jhaylord was found pushed off the third floor. Surveillance cameras were unplugged, but Riez and Yhanna were both seen leaving school around that time.

Messages from Cheska‚Äôs phone were deleted. Police recovered one draft: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to ruin everything.‚Äù Cheska claims she was home, but her alibi has no backup. Riez says he saw her on the third floor that night but didn‚Äôt think it mattered at the time.

Elton and Yhanna were filming a student short film that involved a mock murder scene. During rehearsal, Stephanie was ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù stabbed with what should have been a prop knife. The knife turned out to be real.

Riez, the prop manager, insists he checked all equipment beforehand. Cheska, playing the victim in the next scene, said she saw Elton switch the fake knife with a different one during setup. Elton claims he grabbed what was on the table without thinking and didn‚Äôt know it was real.

Stephanie died on scene. Forensics found Elton‚Äôs fingerprints all over the real knife.
